If you find it difficult to correctly enter proper Serbian latin letters with accents (latinična slova sa kvačicama) in your keyboard layout, you should use this package.\n\n- caron letters (čČššžŽ),\n- acute accent letters (ćĆ),\n- crossed D, D with stroke, crossbar letter D (đĐ)\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease make sure that you have already installed [Espanso](https://espanso.org/install) and then install as Espanso package.\n\n```sh\nespanso install serbian-accents\n```\n\nYou can now start using the package.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply type in the keyword and you will get the replacement. For capital letters, type in the same combination using capital letters and the replacement will also be capitalized.\n\n| Keyword                         | Replaced |\n| ------------------------------- | -------- |\n| `c~` or `cz~`                   | \"č\"      |\n| `s~`                            | \"š\"      |\n| `z~`                            | \"ž~`     |\n| `c~` or `cc~` or `ch~` or `ci~` | \"ć\"      |\n| `d~`                            | \"đ\"      |\n\n## 📄 License\n\nThis espanso package licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/kopach/espanso-package-encircled-letters/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n###### Synonyms and search tags\n\n> letters with diacritical marks, diacritic letters, diacritics, diacritical marks, diacritical signs, accents, accent marks, accented characters, accents and diacritical marks, adding glyph to a letter\n\n","package.yml","matches:\n  - triggers:\n    - \"c~\"\n    - \"cz~\"\n    replace: \"č\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"C~\"\n    - \"Cz~\"\n    - \"CZ~\"\n    replace: \"Č\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"s~\"\n    replace: \"š\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"S~\"\n    replace: \"Š~\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"z~\"\n    replace: \"ž~\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"Z~\"\n    replace: \"Ž\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"c~\"\n    - \"cc~\"\n    - \"ch~\"\n    - \"ci~\"\n    replace: \"ć\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"C~\"\n    - \"Cc~\"\n    - \"CC~\"\n    - \"Ch~\"\n    - \"CH~\"\n    - \"Ci~\"\n    - \"CI~\"\n    replace: \"Ć\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"d~\"\n    replace: \"đ\"\n\n  - triggers:\n    - \"D~\"\n    replace: \"Đ\"","repositoryHome","https://github.com/cvladan/espanso-serbian-accents-package","versions",[16],"isLatest",true]
