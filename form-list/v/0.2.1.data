The sample lines are a good starting point. The basic syntax is:\n\n| Name/description (without quotes) | URL |\n| --- | --- |\n| gmail | https://gmail.com/ |\n\n**Separate the two fields with a comma.** Remember to save the file! Ensure you retain its UTF-8 encoding - spreadsheet programs may switch to UTF-8-BOM.\n\n## Reuse\n\nYou can of course also copy the contents of this package and create multiple form lists with other text. 👍 If you do so, you will need to edit the global variable for the location of the csv file.\n\nRequires Python, but if present should work in all operating systems.","package.yml","# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espanso/espanso/dev/schemas/match.schema.json\n\nglobal_vars:\n  # OS-agnostic derivation of path to CSV file.\n  - name: urlcsv\n    type: script\n    params:\n      args:\n        - python\n        - -c\n        - |\n          import os\n          config_path = os.getenv(\"CONFIG\")\n          print(os.path.join(config_path, \"match\", \"packages\", \"form-list\", \"form_urls.csv\"))\n      \nmatches:\n  - trigger: :forms\n    replace: '{{form_url}}'\n    vars:\n      # Read choice-list options from CSV file.\n      - name: form_names\n        type: script\n        params:\n          args:\n            - python\n            - -c\n            - |\n              import csv\n              with open(r'{{urlcsv}}', newline='') as f:\n                for row in csv.reader(f): print(row[0])\n      # Form\n      - name: choice\n        type: form\n        params:\n          layout: |\n            Get link for:\n            [[choices]]\n          fields:\n            choices:\n              type: list\n              values: '{{form_names}}'\n      # Return paired item as selected above\n      - name: form_url\n        type: script\n        params:\n          args:\n            - python\n            - -c\n            - |\n              import csv\n              with open(r'{{urlcsv}}', newline='') as f:\n                for row in csv.reader(f):\n                  if row[0] == '{{choice.choices}}':\n                    print(row[1]) ; break\n","repositoryHome","versions",[16,43],"0.2.0","isLatest",true]
