Please see the example below. \n\n## Usage\n\nLet's say you want to create a new Espanso shortcut that will allow you to choose between different options such as a list of colors that you frequently use in styling. Or you have a list of co-worker logins that you need to use but can't always remember off-hand. You can use the Form extension to quickly generate a shortcut template to give you a list of options to choose from.\n\nType `:vblf` (verbose list form) in your YAML code-editor and complete the information in the popup form. Once you click `Submit` a form trigger will be pasted in its place. Further edits, such as additional options, or changing the field `type:` to `choice`, can then be inserted.\n\nPlease see [![espanso-verbose-form-template](https://img.youtube.com/vi/videoid/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEGv4aHV1d8)\nfor a short video demo of an earlier version.\n\n```yaml\n# Example usage\n\n  - triggers: ['csscolors--', 'csscol--']\n    replace: \"color:  {{CSS.color_name}}\"\n    vars:\n      - name: \"CSS\"\n        type: form\n        params:\n          layout: \"color_name: [[color_name]]\" \n          fields:\n            color_name:\n              type: list\n              values:\n              - red\n              - orange\n              - black\n              - white\n              - green\n              - blue\n              - purple\n              - pink\n              - yellow\n              - brown\n              - gray\n              - cyan\n              - magenta\n              - lime\n              - teal\n              - indigo\n              - violet\n              - fuchsia\n              - aqua\n              - maroon\n              - navy\n              - olive\n              - silver\n              - limegreen\n              - skyblue\n              - tan\n```\n\n## Source \n\nPlease refer to the awesome documentation for verbose syntax forms here https://espanso.org/docs/matches/forms/#controls-with-the-verbose-syntax\n","_manifest.yml","name: verbose-form-template\ntitle: A form trigger to generate form triggers!\nversion: 1.0.1\nauthor: Omar Elmenawi, reworked by Stephen Meech\ndescription: Espanso shortcode to create espanso forms with the list extension\ntags: [\"shortcut\", \"template\", \"form\", \"yml\"]\nhomepage: https://github.com/menawi/hub/tree/main/packages\n\n\n","repositoryHome","versions",[16],"isLatest",true]
