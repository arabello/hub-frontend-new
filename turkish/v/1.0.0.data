What about `iI`? Is it `İ` or `ı`?\n- It should come **after** the base character. It just feels more natural.\n    - `:` won't work, e.g. \"numbers: 1, 2, 3\" would get replaced with \"numberş 1, 2, 3\"\n- [base] + [trigger] is not a valid combination otherwise.\n    - `e` after vowels: Goethe\n    - `x` after consonants: Matrix\n    - `'`: Marc's\n    - `-`: `i--` (programming)\n\n### Decision\n`-` satisfies almost all of the criteria, except for one: it can have a special meaning in some programming languages. But I prefer `i -= 1` over `i--`, you don't need it that often in most of the modern programming languages anyway (because we have for-in loops). And most people don't write code, so it should be okay. This why I decided to go with `-`.","package.yml","matches:\n  # Turkish Characters   \n  - trigger: \"C-\"\n    replace: \"Ç\"\n        \n  - trigger: \"c-\"\n    replace: \"ç\"\n\n  - trigger: \"S-\"\n    replace: \"Ş\"\n    \n  - trigger: \"s-\"\n    replace: \"ş\"\n        \n  - trigger: \"G-\"\n    replace: \"Ğ\"\n\n  - trigger: \"g-\"\n    replace: \"ğ\"\n  \n  - trigger: \"U-\"\n    replace: \"Ü\"\n        \n  - trigger: \"u-\"\n    replace: \"ü\"\n\n  - trigger: \"O-\"\n    replace: \"Ö\"\n    \n  - trigger: \"o-\"\n    replace: \"ö\"\n        \n  - trigger: \"I-\"\n    replace: \"İ\"\n\n  - trigger: \"i-\"\n    replace: \"ı\"","repositoryHome","versions",[16],"isLatest",true]
